Excellent value for money and we'll definitely return for our next family vacation!",Family Resort,Paris,Family,7,2023-01-22

The concierge helped us plan our entire itinerary with excellent recommendations. The hotel restaurant serves gourmet food that rivals the best restaurants in the city. The spa treatments were world-class. Every staff member we encountered was professional and courteous.",Luxury Palace,Sydney,Leisure,4,2023-01-29
6,"Extremely disappointing experience. Our room was not ready at the scheduled check-in time and we had to wait over 2 hours in the lobby. When we finally got to our room, it was dirty with hair in the bathroom and visible stains on the carpet. The air conditioning was completely broken and it took them an entire day to send someone to fix it. The front desk staff seemed overwhelmed and were not helpful at all.",City Center Inn,Toronto,Business,1,2023-02-05
7,"Terrible value for the price we paid. The room was incredibly small and felt cramped. The furniture looked old and worn out. The wifi was extremely slow and kept disconnecting every few minutes. The breakfast was awful - cold food with very limited options. The elevator was out of order for our entire 3-day stay, forcing us to use the stairs to reach the 8th floor. The parking fees were absolutely outrageous.",Grand Plaza Hotel,Berlin,Solo,3,2023-02-12
8,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced at a hotel. The reception staff were rude and unprofessional from the moment we arrived. Our room wasn't cleaned properly - we found dirty towels still hanging in the bathroom and the bed wasn't even made. We complained multiple times but nothing was done to address our concerns. The restaurant food was cold and overpriced. The pool was closed for maintenance without any prior notice to guests.",City Center Inn,New York,Family,2,2023-02-19
9,"Absolutely unacceptable conditions. The room had a strong cigarette smell despite being advertised as non-smoking. The bathroom had visible mold around the shower area and there was no hot water for the entire duration of our stay. The noise from the street was unbearable - we couldn't sleep at all during the night. The housekeeping staff entered our room without permission while we were out. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.",Business Suites,London,Couple,1,2023-02-26
10,"Complete waste of money. The hotel location is terrible with no restaurants or attractions within walking distance. The room service took over an hour to deliver cold food. The gym equipment is old, broken, and clearly hasn't been maintained. The staff don't speak English well which made communication extremely difficult. The wifi doesn't work in the rooms, only in the lobby. Very frustrating and disappointing stay.",Family Resort,Tokyo,Business,2,2023-03-05
11,"Average hotel experience overall. The room was clean and adequately sized but nothing particularly impressive. The staff were polite and professional but not exceptionally helpful. The breakfast offered standard continental options - nothing special but acceptable. The location is decent with some restaurants and shops within walking distance. The wifi worked reliably throughout our stay. It's an acceptable choice if you just need a place to sleep.",Grand Plaza Hotel,Paris,Solo,1,2023-03-12
12,"Mixed feelings about this hotel stay. The room was comfortable with a good bed, but the bathroom was quite small and cramped. The front desk staff were friendly during check-in but seemed very busy and rushed during the rest of our stay. The hotel restaurant food was decent quality but significantly overpriced for what you get. The pool area was nice but always crowded. Overall, it was okay but not exceptional.",City Center Inn,Sydney,Leisure,3,2023-03-19
13,"Standard business hotel that meets basic expectations. The rooms are clean and functional with reliable amenities. The gym is small but has the essential equipment needed for a workout. The breakfast is typical continental style with the usual options you'd expect. The location is convenient for business meetings with good access to public transportation. The wifi is stable and fast. Nothing exceptional but it serves its purpose for a short business trip.",Business Suites,Toronto,Business,2,2023-03-26
14,"Decent hotel for the price point. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable enough for a good night's sleep. The housekeeping staff did a thorough job cleaning our room daily. The staff were professional throughout our stay but not overly friendly or engaging. The hotel amenities are basic but functional. The location offers good access to public transport. The parking is available but comes with an additional fee. Would consider staying again if the price is right.",Luxury Palace,Berlin,Family,4,2023-04-02
15,"Okay experience that met our basic needs. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and our room was ready exactly on time. The housekeeping staff maintained the room well throughout our stay. The hotel restaurant offers average food with a standard menu - nothing exciting but not bad either. The facilities are well-maintained but not luxurious or modern. Good value for budget-conscious travelers who don't need luxury amenities.",Family Resort,New York,Couple,3,2023-04-09
